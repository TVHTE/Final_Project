# REPORT - Toon van Holthe tot Echten - 10798595

## Intro
For the minor programming, The students were asked to create one final product.
This product could either be an app for mobile devices or a website visualising
data according to a chosen theme. For this final product the visualisation of
the difference between energy produced from fossil & renewable sources was
chosen. A country can be selected by clicking on the world map. The changes
of energy used over the years is shown in a line graph. And the difference
between the two sources and between the selected countries is shown in a
horizontal bar chart. This way not only the transition of energy sources is
shown for a country, but also different countries can be compared.
