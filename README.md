## Problem statement

The visualisation of the world's environment is still lacking attention. This is the reason why the theme of this project is about the worlds energy consumption. In order to give insight in the use of energy by countries two energy sources will be compared for each country. One energy source which is durable and one source like fossil fuel.

## Solution

Firstly the user must select a country from the world map:

When a country is selected the change in energy sources is showed in a line graph.

when more countries are selected and the slider is used, the map visualizes the difference in energy sources and the countries can be compared
