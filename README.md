##### Visualization of origin of energy sources (fossil and renewable) for the world

## Problem statement

The visualisation of the world's environment is still lacking attention. This is the reason why the theme of this project is about the worlds energy consumption. In order to give insight in the use of energy by countries two energy sources will be compared for each country. One energy source which is durable and one source like fossil fuel.
